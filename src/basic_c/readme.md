# Basic C Programs

This repository contains basic C programs that cover a range of topics, including arithmetic operations, number patterns, string operations, and more.

## Arithmetic Operations

- `addition.c`: Performs addition of two numbers.
- `subtraction.c`: Performs subtraction of two numbers.
- `multiplication.c`: Performs multiplication of two numbers.
- `division.c`: Performs division of two numbers.

## Number Patterns and Manipulations

- `armstrong.c`: Checks if a number is an Armstrong number.
- `factorial.c`: Calculates the factorial of a number.
- `fib.c`: Generates the Fibonacci series.
- `fid_rec.c`: Generates the Fibonacci series using recursion
- `factors.c`: Finds the factors of a number.
- `largest.c`: Finds the largest and second largest number
- `largest_of_three.c`: Finds the largest of three numbers.
- `multiplication_table.c`: Generates the multiplication table of a number.
- `odd_or_even.c`: Checks if a number is odd or even.
- `palindrome_num.c`: Checks if a number is a palindrome.
- `palindrome_str.c`: Checks if a string is a palindrome.
- `power.c`: Calculates the power of a number.
- `prime.c`: Checks if a number is prime.
- `quadratic.c`: Solves a quadratic equation.
- `strong.c`: Checks whether a given number is a strong number or not
- `swap.c`: Swaps the values of two variables.

## Strings
- `occurrences.c`: Program to Count the Occurrences of a Character in a String
- `str_len.c`: Program to Calculate String Length

## Other Topics

- `hello_world.c`: Prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
- `personal_greeting.c`: Prompts the user for their name and displays a personalized greeting.
- `printf_formatting.c`: Demonstrates various formatting options in the printf function.
- `escape_sequence.c`: Demonstrates the use of escape sequences in C.

## Usage

1. Compile the C file using a C compiler:
```bash
gcc addition.c -o addition
```

2. Run the compiled program:
```bash
./addition
```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions or check the comments in the program to understand its behavior.
